# FAQ

### Why Arduino? A Raspberry PI is much more powerful.
Yes, but much more complicated to install, larger and takes MUCH more battery power. Are there any features missing? I don't think so. Noko is as good as it is.

### Why this crappy LCD? There are cheap colorful touchscreens.
Yes, there are, but the LC display should be an easy-to-read clock and a lightsource. Besides, the Arduino ressources are very VERY limited. Noko doesn't need a touchscreen. He has buttons for a more haptical experience.

### Is it possible to fast forward a story or an own MP3?
No, it is not supported by the JQ6500-Module. 
  
### Why does it not do or have XXX?
You got a good idea? Write me!

### When did your work on Noko start?
I started wasting my time in March, 2014.
