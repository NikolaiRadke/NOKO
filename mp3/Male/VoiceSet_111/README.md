| Number  | Assignment               |
| --------|-------------------------:|
| 001-010 | Free NOKIA alarm tunes   |
| 011-030 | Response to belly button |
| 031-060 | Response to nose button  |
| 061-080 | Response to ultrasonic   |
| 081-110 | Time based events        |
| 111     | Birthday song            |

011-110 have been spoken by my fellow actor [Carsten Caniglia](https://filmmakers.de/carsten-caniglia). Why? 
He has done a great job - moreover I don't want to listen to my own voice every day, especially when development takes more than a year! (Ian said I sound really weird in real life. Thanks, mate.)
